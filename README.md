#hello-atom-shell

***NOTE: This does not currently work and atom-shell reports the application
as not a valid atom-shell app***

This is a port of the atom-shell hello-app application to Clojurescript.

The hello-app can be seen on the atom-shell Quick Start page:

##Issue

This application does not work and I don't know why yet. All I get is a message
saying that the app is not a valid atom-shell app. I've looked over the Quick Start
page and my code for hours and cannot find where the issue may be.
